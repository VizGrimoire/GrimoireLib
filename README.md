# GrimoireLib

GrimoireLib is a Python library to make life easier to those using [Metrics Grimoire](http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/) tools and [vizGrimoireJS](https://github.com/VizGrimoire/VizGrimoireJS).

## Dependecies

Currently, GrimoireLib depends on:
- MySQL-python
- SQLAlchemy
- Scipy
- Numpy

## Install

Once dependencies are installed, just:

<pre><code>$ python setup.py install</code></pre>

PIP packages are _under development_

# Usage

GrimoireLib _plays_ with the data generated by Metrics Grimoire tools, doing queries to the databases created by them.

To know more about how GrimoireLib works, there are some reference posts from [Bitergia's blog](http://blog.bitergia.com):
- [Data, data and data about your favourite community: GrimoireLib](http://blog.bitergia.com/2015/02/25/data-data-data-about-your-favourite-community/)
- [Behind the big numbers on the Wikimedia code review process](http://blog.bitergia.com/2015/03/17/behind-the-big-numbers-on-the-wikimedia-code-review-process/)

Under `vizGrimoireJS/` directory there are serveral `.py` scripts to produce different sets of data (mainly in `.json` format). For example `vizGrimoireJS/report_tool.py` is used to create the json
files that are used by [vizGrimoireJS dashboard](https://github.com/VizGrimoire/VizGrimoireJS).
