# There are cases where the whole analysis process should be re-started.
# However once affiliations are tunned, it's a hard work to re-start this
# specific task.
# This script aims at re-filling the upeople_companies table when a CVSAnalY
# database is restarted. As input, this script needs a file with the following
# structure: identity;company;init_date;end_date
# The whole process should be as follows:
# 1- Obtain previous mentioned file with the following query:
# select distinct u.identifier, c.name, upc.init, upc.end from people_upeople pup, upeople u, upeople_companies upc, companies c where u.id=upc.upeople_id and upc.company_id = c.id and u.id=pup.upeople_id order by u.identifier into outfile '/tmp/affiliations.csv' fields terminated by ':' lines terminated by '\n';
# 2- Re-run cvsanaly 
# 3- Re-run unifypeople.py script, so identities, upeople and people_upeople tables are created and populated
# 4- Copy old companies table as follows: create table companies as select * from <old_database>.companies
# 5- Run this script: $ python restore_affiliations.py <database> <file with affs>
